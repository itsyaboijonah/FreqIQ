# FreqIQ

This project implements a simple iOS quiz game for refining the player's ability to hear and distinguish between frequency bands.

For each question in the quiz, the player will hear a pink noise sample with one of 10 possible frequencies boosted by 12dB. They must then select the correct option out of 4 possible answers, with their total score being tracked throughout the quiz.

This project was initially developed as a way for me to simultaneously train my ears, and learn Swift development principles.
